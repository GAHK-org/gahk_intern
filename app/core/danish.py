"""Danish month names, in one place.

Django's `|date` filter localises perfectly well with LANGUAGE_CODE="da", and every template that
only needs a formatted date should keep using it. This exists for the cases that build a label in
PYTHON — "September 2026" on the calendar header, "marts 2024" in the alumneliste, the kvotient
month index — where there is no template filter to reach for.

It was copy-pasted twice before this: residents.views.DA_MONTHS (1-indexed, with a leading "") and
rooms.kvotient._DA_MONTHS (0-indexed, no blank). Two subtly different conventions for the same
twelve strings is exactly the drift worth removing, and the calendar in `events` was about to be the
third. One-indexed won because that is what `datetime.month` gives you.
