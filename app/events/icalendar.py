"""RFC 5545 output: one event as a download, and a resident's own feed to subscribe to.

Hand-rolled, and that is the same call core.push made about django-webpush. We only ever EMIT, and
only VCALENDAR + VEVENT with about a dozen properties. The `icalendar` package is a parser as well
as a builder, and the parsing half would be permanent attack surface and a permanent pip-audit
obligation for code nothing here would ever call. CI runs pip-audit over the locked production
dependencies on every push; a text format does not earn a place in that set.

`icalendar` IS a dev dependency, used by one test as an independent oracle: hand-rolled in
production, parsed by somebody else's implementation in CI is a better answer than either alone.

THREE THINGS ARE EASY TO GET WRONG HERE, and each has a test:

  * **Folding is by OCTET, not character.** Lines are wrapped at 75 octets, and `æ ø å` are two
    bytes each in UTF-8. Counting characters overshoots; slicing bytes naively splits a
    continuation byte and Apple Calendar renders mojibake. `_fold` walks to a boundary that is not
    a continuation byte.
  * **Escaping order.** Backslash first, then `;` `,` and newline. Do the backslash last and every
    other escape gets double-escaped.
  * **CRLF, everywhere.** Not "\\n". Several clients accept LF; the ones that do not fail silently.

AND ONE THING IS AVOIDED RATHER THAN GOT RIGHT: there is no VTIMEZONE. Every DATE-TIME is emitted
as UTC with a Z suffix. A correct VTIMEZONE for Europe/Copenhagen means shipping RRULE-based DST
transition rules, and a wrong one shifts every event by an hour twice a year — a bug written in
March and reported in April. Clients render UTC instants in the viewer's own zone, which they
already do correctly, so DST stops being our problem. The cost is that the raw file reads in UTC
when you are debugging it.
